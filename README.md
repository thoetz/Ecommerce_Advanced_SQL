# Ecommerce_Advanced_SQL
Working through the Maven Analytics Advanced SQL course projects and assignments. 

During the course, I played the role of a data analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce start-up. In this repository, I showcase my proficiency and fluency in SQL by applying various tools and techniques learned throughout the course to real-world projects. I've collaborated directly with the CEO, Marketing Director, and Website Manager to analyze performance and drive business growth using advanced SQL analytics. Throughout the course, I utilized MySQL alongside MySQL Workbench to execute queries and perform comprehensive analyses.

## Summary of Concepts

### Traffic Analysis & Optimization

# SQL Programming Concepts and Techniques

1. **SELECT statements**: Used to retrieve data from the database tables.
2. **YEAR() and MONTH() functions**: Extract year and month components from dates.
3. **COUNT() function**: Counts the number of rows or values in a specified column.
4. **CASE COUNT Method**: Used to pivot data for analysis.
5. **LEFT JOIN**: Joins two tables based on a condition specified after the ON keyword, returning all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
6. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, typically used with aggregate functions like COUNT() to perform operations on each group.
7. **Temporary Tables**: Created using the `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement to store intermediate results for further processing within the session.
8. **CASE WHEN statements**: Used for conditional logic, allowing different actions to be taken based on specified conditions.
9. **Aggregate Functions**: Used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. In this case, COUNT() is used as an aggregate function.
10. **Subqueries**: Not explicitly used in the provided code, but could be utilized in future queries to perform nested queries within the main query.
11. **Mathematical Operations**: Used to calculate conversion rates and other derived metrics.
12. **Date Filtering**: Filtering data based on specific date ranges using the WHERE clause.

These concepts and techniques demonstrate a strong understanding of SQL fundamentals and advanced data analysis capabilities. You can list them in your portfolio to showcase your proficiency in SQL programming and data analysis.
